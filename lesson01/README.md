# Lesson 1 of Code Camp

## How does the web work?
* Files in a filesystem (analogy to finding objects in a house/floor/room/cabinet/shelf/box/item
* Types of files (text - letter, image - picture, data - game token / unknown)
* Each type of file has a different use / method of consumption / application(!)
* Some files contain instructions, other files contain descriptions, other files contain rules
* Client vs. Server whiteboard a web request

## Inspire them on the journey
* If you have a great idea, and study hard to implement it, you can share it with the world
* with parental permission
* Computer programming is a vocation.  You can get a job doing this stuff.
* Creative arts.  Math.  Language.  Management of people and projects.  History.  Psychology.

## Robot turtle
* show a blank whiteboard
* sketch out a cartesian coordinate system
* the "address" of each point is represented by a tuple (x,y)
* "instruct my pen to draw a rectangle"
* make random assumptions about where to start, what color, reveal drawing to user to force them to be very specific
* instruct my pen to draw a triangle
* instruct my pen to draw a circle (probably can't do it)

## A bit of javascript
* javascript console
* variables, operators, expressions
* introduce the game we will create together
